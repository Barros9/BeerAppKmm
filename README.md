# BeerAppKmm

Following [BeerApp](https://github.com/Barros9/BeerApp), created a similar app using [KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mpp-intro.html). 
Used [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) to display and search beers.

The common module uses:
* [Ktor](https://ktor.io/docs/http-client-multiplatform.html#add-dependencies) for network calls 
* [Kodein](https://docs.kodein.org/kodein-di/7.10/core/install.html) for dependecy injection

The Android module was implemented using [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

Please note that iOS module has not been implemented.
